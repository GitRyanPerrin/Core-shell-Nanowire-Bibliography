	abstract = {We consider electrons in tubular nanowires with prismatic geometry and infinite length. Such a model corresponds to a core-shell nanowire with an insulating core and a conductive shell. In a prismatic shell the lowest energy states are localized along the edges (corners) of the prism and are separated by a considerable energy gap from the states localized on the prism facets. The corner localization is robust in the presence of a magnetic field longitudinal to the wire. If the magnetic field is transversal to the wire the lowest states can be shifted to the lateral regions of the shell, relatively to the direction of the field. These localization effects should be observable in transport experiments on semiconductor core-shell nanowires, typically with hexagonal geometry. We show that the conductance of the prismatic structures considerably differs from the one of circular nanowires. The effects are observed for sufficiently thin hexagonal wires and become much more pronounced for square and triangular shells. To the best of our knowledge, the internal geometry of such nanowires is not revealed in experimental studies. We show that with properly designed nanowires these localization effects may become an important resource of interesting phenomenology.},

	abstract = {Temperature dependent electronic properties of GaSb/InAsSb core/shell and GaSb nanowires have been studied. Results from two-probe and four-probe measurements are compared to distinguish between extrinsic (contact-related) and intrinsic (nanowire) properties. It is found that a thin (2–3 nm) InAsSb shell allows low barrier charge carrier injection to the GaSb core, and that the presence of the shell also improves intrinsic nanowire mobility and conductance in comparison to bare GaSb nanowires. Maximum intrinsic field effect mobilities of 200 and 42 cm2 Vs−1 were extracted for the GaSb/InAsSb core/shell and bare-GaSb NWs at room temperature, respectively. The temperature-dependence of the mobility suggests that ionized impurity scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism in bare GaSb while phonon scattering dominates in core/shell nanowires. Top-gated field effect transistors were fabricated based on radial GaSb/InAsSb heterostructure nanowires with shell thicknesses in the range 5–7 nm. The fabricated devices exhibited ambipolar conduction, where the output current was studied as a function of AC gate voltage and frequency. Frequency doubling was experimentally demonstrated up to 20 kHz. The maximum operating frequency was limited by parasitic capacitance associated with the measurement chip geometry.},

By applying a magnetic field along the nanowire axis, regular magnetoconductance oscillations with an amplitude in the order of e2/h are observed. The oscillation amplitude is found to be larger by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the measurements of a reference sample with normal metal contacts. For the Nb-contacted core/shell nanowire the oscillation period corresponds to half a flux quantum Φ0/2 = h/2e in contrast to the period of Φ0 of the reference sample. The strongly enhanced magnetoconductance oscillations are explained by phase-coherent resonant Andreev reflections at the Nb-core/shell nanowire interface.},

For a homogeneous growth of the InAs shell, the As4 flux and substrate temperature are critical. The shell growth starts with InAs islands along the NW core, which increase in time and merge giving finally a continuous and smooth layer. At the top of the NWs, a small part of the core is free of InAs indicating a crystal phase selective growth. This allows a precise measurement of the shell thickness and the fabrication of InAs nanotubes by selective etching. The strain relaxation in the shell occurs mainly via the formation of misfit dislocations and saturates at ∼80\%. Additionally, other types of defects are observed, namely stacking faults transferred from the core or formed in the shell, and threading dislocations.},

An unusual triangular InP shell with predominantly 112A facets instead of 112B facets is reported. It is found that this polarity preference is due to the surfactant role of Sb, which inhibits InP shell growth rate in the 〈112〉A directions. This behavior reveals a new degree of control and tunability allowed in manipulating nanowire facet geometry and polarity in radial heterostructures by a simple means. Tuning the Sb composition in the core yields controllable intense photoluminescence emission in both the 1.3 and 1.5 μm optical telecommunication windows, up to room temperature for single nanowires. The internal quantum efficiency of the core/shell nanowires is experimentally determined to be as high as 56\% at room temperature. Transient Rayleigh scattering analysis brings complementary information, revealing the photoexcited carrier lifetime in the core/shell nanowire to be ≈100 ps at 300 K and ≈800 ps at 10 K. In comparison, the carrier lifetime of core-only nanowire is below the detection limit of the system (25 ps). The demonstrated superior optical quality of the core/shell nanowires and their ideal emission wavelength range makes them highly relevant candidates for near-infrared optoelectronic applications.},

	abstract = {Coaxial core/shell nanowires represent an important class of nanoscale building blocks with substantial potential for exploring new concepts and materials for solar energy conversion. Here, we report the first experimental realization of coaxial group III−nitride nanowire photovoltaic (PV) devices, n-GaN/i-InxGa1−xN/p-GaN, where variation of indium mole fraction is used to control the active layer band gap and hence light absorption. Current−voltage data reveal clear diode characteristics with ideality factors from 3.9 to 5.6. Electroluminescence measurements demonstrate tunable emission from 556 to 371 nm and thus confirm band gap variations in the InxGa1−xN active layer from 2.25 to 3.34 eV as In composition is varied. Simulated one-sun AM 1.5G illumination yielded open-circuit voltages (Voc) from 1.0 to 2.0 V and short-circuit current densities (Jsc) from 0.39 to 0.059 mA/cm2 as In composition is decreased from 0.27 to 0 and a maximum efficiency of ∼0.19\%. The n-GaN/i-InxGa1−xN/p-GaN nanowire devices are highly robust and exhibit enhanced efficiencies for concentrated solar light illuminations as well as single nanowire Jsc values as high as 390 mA/cm2 under intense short-wavelength illumination. The ability to rationally tune the structure and composition of these core/shell III−nitride nanowires will make them a powerful platform for exploring nanoenabled PVs in the future.},

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy clearly shows shells with distinct chemical compositions, and quantitatively confirms that the thickness and composition of individual shells can be well controlled during synthesis.

Theoretical calculations of NW electronic structure confirm quantum confinement of carriers at the core/shell interface due to the presence of ionized carbon acceptors in the 1 nm GaAs layer in the shell. Microphotoluminescence in high magnetic field shows a clear signature of avoided crossings of the n = 0 Landau level emission line with the n = 2 Landau level TO phonon replica.

	abstract = {Magneto-photoluminescence measurements of individual zinc-blende GaAs/AlAs core/shell nanowires are reported. At low temperature, a strong emission line at 1.507 eV is observed under low power (nW) excitation. Measurements performed in high magnetic field allowed us to detect in this emission several lines associated with excitons bound to defect pairs. Such lines were observed before in epitaxial GaAs of very high quality, as reported by Kunzel and Ploog. This demonstrates that the optical quality of our GaAs/AlAs core/shell nanowires is comparable to the best GaAs layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Moreover, strong free exciton emission is observed even at room temperature. The bright optical emission of our nanowires in room temperature should open the way for numerous optoelectronic device applications.},

Owing to the band alignment between GaAs and InAs, electrons are accumulated in the InAs shell as long as the shell thickness exceeds 12 nm. By performing simulations using a Schrödinger–Poisson solver, it is confirmed that confined states are present in the InAs shell, which are depleted if the shell thickness is below a threshold value. The existence of a tubular-shaped conductor is proved by performing magnetoconductance measurements at low temperatures. Here, flux periodic conductance oscillations are observed which can be attributed to transport in one-dimensional channels based on angular momentum states.},

	abstract = {III/V semiconductor nanostructures have significant potential in device applications, but effective surface passivation is critical due to their large surface-to-volume ratio. For InP such passivation has proven particularly difficult, with substantial depassivation generally observed following dielectric deposition on InP surfaces. We present a novel approach based on passivation with a phosphorus-rich interfacial oxide deposited using a low-temperature process, which is critical to avoid P-desorption. For this purpose we have chosen a POx layer deposited in a plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) system at room temperature. Since POx is known to be hygroscopic and therefore unstable in atmosphere, we encapsulate this layer with a thin ALD Al2O3 capping layer to form a POx/Al2O3 stack. This passivation scheme is capable of improving the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of our state-of-the-art wurtzite (WZ) InP nanowires by a factor of ∼20 at low excitation. If we apply the rate equation analysis advocated by some authors, we derive a PL internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 75\% for our passivated wires at high excitation. Our results indicate that it is more reliable to calculate the IQE as the ratio of the integrated PL intensity at room temperature to that at 10 K. By this means we derive an IQE of 27\% for the passivated wires at high excitation ({\textgreater}10 kW cm–2), which constitutes an unprecedented level of performance for undoped InP nanowires. This conclusion is supported by time-resolved PL decay lifetimes, which are also shown to be significantly higher than previously reported for similar wires. The passivation scheme displays excellent long-term stability ({\textgreater}7 months) and is additionally shown to substantially improve the thermal stability of InP surfaces ({\textgreater}300 °C), significantly expanding the temperature window for device processing. Such effective surface passivation is a key enabling technology for InP nanowire devices such as nanolasers and solar cells.},

Localization and interchannel tunnel coupling are controlled by the curvature at the edges and the diameter of the underlying nanowire. We also show that a magnetic ﬁeld may induce either Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of the energy levels in the axial conﬁguration, or a dimensional transition of the quantum states from quasi-1D to Landau levels for ﬁelds normal to the axis.

	abstract = {In the past decade, there has been significant interest in the potentially advantageous thermoelectric properties of one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, but it has been challenging to find high thermoelectric power factors based on 1D effects in practice. Here we point out that there is an upper limit to the thermoelectric power factor of nonballistic 1D nanowires, as a consequence of the recently established quantum bound of thermoelectric power output. We experimentally test this limit in quasiballistic InAs nanowires by extracting the maximum power factor of the first 1D subband through I−V characterization, finding that the measured maximum power factors conform to the theoretical limit. The established limit allows the prediction of the achievable power factor of a specific nanowire material system with 1D electronic transport based on the nanowire dimension and mean free path. The power factor of state-of-the-art semiconductor nanowires with small cross section and high crystal quality can be expected to be highly competitive (on the order of mW/m K2) at low temperatures. However, they have no clear advantage over bulk materials at, or above, room temperature.},

	abstract = {The [111]-oriented InAs/GaSb and GaSb/InAs core-shell nanowires have been studied by the 8 × 8 Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to search for non-vanishing fundamental gaps between inverted electron and hole bands. We focus on the variations of the band-inverted fundamental gap, the hybridization gap, and the effective gap with the core radius and shell thickness of the nanowires. The evolutions of all the energy gaps with the structural parameters are shown to be dominantly governed by the effect of quantum confinement. With a fixed core radius, a band-inverted fundamental gap exists only at intermediate shell thicknesses. The maximum band-inverted gap found is {\textasciitilde}4.4 meV for GaSb/InAs and {\textasciitilde}3.5 meV for InAs/GaSb core-shell nanowires, and for the GaSb/InAs core-shell nanowires the gap persists over a wider range of geometrical parameters. The intrinsic reason for these differences between the two types of nanowires is that in the shell the electron-like states of InAs is more delocalized than the hole-like state of GaSb, while in the core the hole-like state of GaSb is more delocalized than the electron-like state of InAs, and both favor a stronger electron-hole hybridization.},

	abstract = {We report on a theoretical study of the electronic structures of freestanding nanowires made from narrow band gap semiconductors GaSb, InSb and InAs. The nanowires are described by the eight-band k.p Hamiltonians and the band structures are computed by means of the finite element method in a mixture basis consisting of linear triangular elements inside the nanowires and constrained Hermite triangular elements near the boundaries. The nanowires with two crystallographic orientations, namely the [001] and [111] orientations, and with different cross-sectional shapes are considered. For each orientation, the nanowires of the three narrow band gap semiconductors are found to show qualitatively similar characteristics in the band structures. However, the nanowires oriented along the two different crystallographic directions are found to show different characteristics in the valence bands. In particular, it is found that all the conduction bands show simple, good parabolic dispersions in both the [001]- and [111]-oriented nanowires, while the top valence bands show double-maximum structures in the [001]-oriented nanowires, but single-maximum structures in the [111]-oriented nanowires. The wave functions and spinor distributions of the band states in these nanowires are also calculated. It is found that significant mixtures of electron and hole states appear in the bands of these narrow band gap semiconductor nanowires. The wave functions exhibit very different distribution patterns in the nanowires oriented along the [001] direction and the nanowires oriented along the [111] direction. It is also shown that single-band effective mass theory could not reproduce all the band state wave functions presented in this work.},

	abstract = {Semiconductor nanowires featuring strong spin–orbit interactions (SOI), represent a promising platform for a broad range of novel technologies, such as spintronic applications or topological quantum computation. However, experimental studies into the nature and the orientation of the SOI vector in these wires remain limited despite being of upmost importance. Typical devices feature the nanowires placed on top of a substrate which modifies the SOI vector and spoils the intrinsic symmetries of the system. In this work, we report experimental results on suspended InAs nanowires, in which the wire symmetries are fully preserved and clearly visible in transport measurements. Using a vectorial magnet, the nontrivial evolution of weak antilocalization (WAL) is tracked through all 3D space, and both the spin–orbit length lSO and coherence length lφ are determined as a function of the magnetic field magnitude and direction. Studying the angular maps of the WAL signal, we demonstrate that the average SOI within the nanowire is isotropic and that our findings are consistent with a semiclassical quasi-1D model of WAL adapted to include the geometrical constraints of the nanostructure. Moreover, by acting on properly designed side gates, we apply an external electric field introducing an additional vectorial Rashba spin–orbit component whose strength can be controlled by external means. These results give important hints on the intrinsic nature of suspended nanowire and can be interesting for the field of spintronics as well as for the manipulation of Majorana bound states in devices based on hybrid semiconductors.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of the oft-neglected cubic terms of the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling on the longitudinal current response of a two-dimensional electron gas with both Rashba and linear Dresselhaus interactions. For a quantum well grown in the [001] direction, the changes caused by these nonlinear-in-momentum terms on the absorption spectrum become more notable under SU(2) symmetry conditions, when the Rashba and linear Dresselhaus coupling strengths are tuned to be equal. The longitudinal optical response no longer vanishes then and shows a strong dependence on the direction of the externally applied electric field, giving a signature of the relative size of several spin-orbit contributions. This anisotropic response arises from the nonisotropic splitting of the spin states induced by the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings. However, the presence of cubic terms introduces characteristic spectral features and can modify the overall shape of the spectra for some values of the relative sizes of the spin-orbit parameters. We compare this behavior to the case of a sample with [110] crystal orientation which, under conditions of spin-preserving symmetry, has a collinear spin-orbit vector field that leads to vanishing conductivity, even in the presence of cubic terms. In addition to the control through the driven frequency or electrical gating, such a directional aspect of the current response suggests new ways of manipulation and supports the use of interband optics as a sensitive probe of spin-orbit mechanisms in semiconductor spintronics.},

Here, we present an approach, in which a designed twinning superlattice with the zinc blende crystal structure or the wurtzite crystal structure is transferred from a gallium phosphide core wire to an epitaxially grown silicon shell. These materials have a difference in lattice constants of only 0.4\%, which allows for structure transfer without introducing extra defects.

The ZT value of multiple core-shell NWs can reach three times greater than that of the single component GaSb NWs at room temperature. Moreover, the ZT values of both the core-shell NWs and single component NWs are increased with the increasing temperature, but the ZT value of core-shell NWs increases more slowly than that of single component NWs.

	abstract = {The spin precession in a cylindrical semiconductor nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling has been investigated theoretically using an InAs nanowire containing a surface two-dimensional electron gas as a model. The eigenstates, energy-momentum dispersion, and the energy-magnetic field dispersion relation are determined by solving the Schrödinger equation in a cylindrical symmetry. The combination of states with the same total angular momentum but opposite spin orientation results in a periodic modulation of the axial spin component along the axis of the wire. Spin-precession about the wires axis is achieved by interference of two states with different total angular momentum. Because a superposition state with exact opposite spin precession exists at zero magnetic field, an oscillation of the spin orientation can be obtained. If an axially oriented magnetic field is applied, the spin gains an additional precessing component.},

	abstract = {We investigated the magnetotransport of InAs nanowires grown by selective-area metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. In the temperature range between 0.5 and 30 K reproducible fluctuations in the conductance upon variation in the magnetic field or the backgate voltage are observed, which are attributed to electron interference effects in small disordered conductors. From the correlation field of the magnetoconductance fluctuations the phase-coherence length lϕ is determined. At the lowest temperatures lϕ is found to be at least 300 nm while for temperatures exceeding 2 K a monotonous decrease in lϕ with temperature is observed. A direct observation of the weak antilocalization effect indicating the presence of spin-orbit coupling is masked by the strong magnetoconductance fluctuations. However, by averaging the magnetoconductance over a range of gate voltages a clear peak in the magnetoconductance due to the weak antilocalization effect was resolved. By comparison of the experimental data to simulations based on a recursive two-dimensional Green’s-function approach a spin-orbit scattering length of approximately 70 nm was extracted, indicating the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.},

	abstract = {We report on the sensing properties of p–n CuO–ZnO core–shell nanowires (C–S NWs) for reducing gases. The C–S NWs were synthesized by a two-step process: first, core p–CuO nanowires were prepared by thermal oxidation on patterned interdigital electrodes, forming a network; and second, the n–ZnO shell layers were subsequently deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The ZnO shell thickness was controlled by changing the number of ALD cycles between 5 and 110nm. The sensing properties of the C–S NWs were investigated for the typical reducing gases CO and C6H6. At 35nm shell thickness, the C–S NWs showed the highest CO and C6H6 sensing ability, superior to that of pristine p–CuO nanowires. The sensing mechanism of the p–n C–S NWs is based on the radial modulation of an electron-depletion region in the ZnO shell layer, which occurs during the interaction between the reducing gas molecules and the adsorbed oxygen species and causes a pronounced change in resistance. This demonstrates that the radial modulation of the conducting channel is a universal sensing principle operating in p–n type C–S structures.},

	abstract = {We report the strain dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of InAs-based heterostructures and discuss the controllability of the Dresselhaus effect. Our heterostructures were designed to possess symmetric band structure to eliminate the Rashba effect, and its channel is naturally and compressively strained due to lattice mismatch in the InP (100) substrate. Slight mechanical tensile strain turned out to modify the SdH oscillations from complex to simple ones. The highly distorted oscillations at natural state resemble the ones commonly observed when the second sub-band is occupied, though we confirmed that the second sub-band is not occupied in our structure. Gate modulation further enhanced the distortion and we did not observe beating at any gate voltages. Taking the large Zeeman effect in InAs into account, obtained results indicate that the interaction between spin–orbit (SO) interaction and Zeeman effect caused the unequal shift of spin-up and spin-down Landau levels (LLs) and their hybridization.},

As shells were grown on GaAs substrates by the Au-assisted vapour-liquid-solid method in a gas source molecular beam epitaxy system. Core diameters and shell thicknesses were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These measurements were then related to selected area diffraction patterns to verify either interface coherency or relaxation through misfit dislocations. A theoretical strain model is presented to determine the critical shell thickness for given core diameters. Zincblende stiffness parameters are transformed to their wurtzite counterparts via a well known tensor transformation. An energy criterion is then given to determine the shell thickness, at which coherency is lost and dislocations become favourable. Our model only considers axial strain relieved by edge dislocations since they were the only type of dislocation observed directly by TEM.},

Our results show that a simple deposition of a Ge shell of only 1 to 2 unit cells in thickness on a single crystalline Si nanowire can lead to a dramatic 75\% decrease in thermal conductivity at room temperature compared to an uncoated Si nanowire. By analyzing the vibrational density states of phonons and the participation ratio of each specific mode, we demonstrate that the reduction in the thermal conductivity of Si/Ge core−shell nanowire stems from the depression and localization of long-wavelength phonon modes at the Si/Ge interface and of high frequency nonpropagating diffusive modes.},

	abstract = {The heteroepitaxial growth of crystalline core−shell nanostructures of a variety of materials has become possible in recent years, allowing the realization of various novel nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices. The increased surface or interface area will decrease the thermal conductivity of such nanostructures and impose challenges for the thermal management of such devices. In the meantime, the decreased thermal conductivity might benefit the thermoelectric conversion efficiency. In this paper, we present modeling results on the lattice thermal conductivity of core−shell and tubular nanowires along the wire axis direction using the phonon Boltzmann equation. We report the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the surface conditions and the core−shell geometry for silicon core−germanium shell and tubular silicon nanowires at room temperature. The results show that the effective thermal conductivity changes not only with the composition of the constituents but also with the radius of the nanowires and nanopores due to the nature of the ballistic phonon transport. The results in this work have implications for the design and operation of a variety of nanoelectronic devices, optoelectronic devices, and thermoelectric materials and devices.},
